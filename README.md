Explanation of Each Folder
data/: Contains all data-related files.

raw/: Original datasets.
processed/: Cleaned datasets ready for modeling.
external/: Any external datasets used in the project.
interim/: Intermediate data files during processing.
sample/: Small sample datasets for quick testing.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and model comparisons.

src/: The main source code for your application.

data/: Scripts for loading and preprocessing data.
models/: Scripts for model training, selection, and prediction.
utils/: Helper functions for visualization and metrics.
config.py: Central configuration file for easy adjustments.
tests/: Contains unit tests to ensure code reliability.

requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

README.md: Provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage.

main.py: The main entry point for running the application.

The folder structure is created using the python file "create_structure.py" as shown b elow:

Explanation:

Folder Structure Definition: The folder_structure dictionary defines the structure you want to create, with directories as keys and nested dictionaries or empty strings for files.

Function create_structure:

Takes a base_path and a structure dictionary.
Iterates through the items in the structure.
Creates directories using os.makedirs() and files using open().
Execution: The script calls create_structure() with "." as the base path, which creates the folders and files in the current directory.

Running the Script:
After running the script, you will have the folder structure in your local directory. You can then initialize a Git repository, add the files, commit, and push to your GitHub repository:

Copy
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial folder structure for fraud detection project"
git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
git push -u origin master
Replace <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository. This will upload your newly created folder structure to GitHub.
Save the script to a Python file, e.g., create_structure.py.

After running the script, you will have the folder structure in your local directory. You can then initialize a Git repository, add the files, commit, and push to your GitHub repository:

Copy
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial folder structure for fraud detection project"
git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
git push -u origin master
Replace <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository. This will upload your newly created folder structure to GitHub.
